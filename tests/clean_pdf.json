Featuring an integrated media\naccess control (MAC) and a switch, the ADIN2111 enables direct\nconnectivity with a variety of controllers via a serial peripheral interface (SPI). The switch (cut through or store and forward) supports\nvarious routing configurations between the two Ethernet ports and\nthe SPI host port providing a flexible solution for line, daisy-chain,\nor ring network topologies.\nThe ADIN2111 can be used in unmanaged configurations where the\ndevice automatically forwards the traffic between the two Ethernet\nports.\nThe device integrates the switch, two Ethernet physical layer (PHY)\ncores with a MAC interface and all the associated analog circuitry,\nand input and output clock buffering. The device also includes\ninternal buffer queues, the SPI and subsystem registers, as well\nas the control logic to manage the reset and clock control and\nhardware pin configuration.\nThe ADIN2111 has an integrated voltage supply monitoring circuit\nand power-on reset (POR) circuitry to improve system level robustness. The 4-wire SPI for communication with the host can be\nconfigured to OPEN Alliance SPI or generic SPI. Both modes\nsupport optional data protection or cyclic redundancy check (CRC).\n\n\u25ba Factory automation\n\u25ba Condition monitoring and machine connectivity\n\nRev.

The chip is available on a 7 mm \u00d7 7 mm, 48-lead\nlead frame chip scale package (LFCSP) and includes the following\nfeatures:\n\nIn a single-supply application, connect AVDD_H and AVDD_L to\nVDDIO and connect DVDD1_1P1 to DLDO1_1P1 and DVDD2_1P1\nto DLDO2_1P1. The appropriate supply voltage used depends on\nthe end application and cable length. A recommended circuit is\nshown in the Single-Supply Configuration section.\n\n\u25ba Two Ethernet PHY cores with common analog circuitry\n\u25ba 10 Mbps full duplex SPI for frame transfer and system register\n\ncontrol\n\n\u25ba MAC with support for 16 MAC addresses\n\u25ba Switch with cut through or store and forward operation\n\u25ba SPI to MDIO bridge to access the PHY registers\n\u25ba Input and output clock buffering\n\u25ba On-chip first in, first outs (FIFOs):\n\u25ba 8 kB high priority reception FIFO for the SPI host port\n\u25ba 8 kB low priority reception FIFO for the SPI host port\n\nLong Reach and Trunk/Spur Applications\nThe 1.0 V p-p transmit operating mode supports the spur use case\nand can operate at a lower AVDD_H supply voltage of 1.8 V. The\nADIN2111 in this mode supports intrinsic safety applications.\nThe higher transmit operating mode of 2.4 V p-p supports trunk\napplications and requires a higher AVDD_H supply voltage of 3.3 V;\notherwise, the device cannot start up. This mode can be used for\nlonger cable lengths in industrial Ethernet environments with higher\nnoise levels.\n\n\u25ba 8 kB transmission FIFO for the two Ethernet ports\n\nANALOG FRONT-END\n\n\u25ba 4 kB transmission FIFO for the SPI host\n\nThe AFE stage consists of a hybrid stage, 9-level DAC, line driver,\nanalog receive filter, input buffer, and ADC.\n\n\u25ba Hardware configuration pins\n\u25ba Configurable hardware interrupt pin\n\u25ba Four configurable LED pins for activity monitoring\n\nNote that two different SPI protocols are supported to communicate\nwith the switch: a generic SPI protocol similar to protocols used in\nother Analog Devices products, and the OPEN Alliance MACPHY\nSPI protocol.\n\nThe line driver transmits the signal onto the line via the Port 1\n(respectively Port 2) MDI interface pins, P1_TXP and P1_TXN\n(respectively P2_TXP and P2_TXN). The hybrid stage subtracts the\ntransmitted signal from the received signal on the Port 1 (respectively Port 2) MDI pins, thereby allowing full duplex operation on the\nsingle-pair cable.\n\nPOWER SUPPLY DOMAINS\n\nThe received signal then passes through the analog receive filter\nand reaches the input buffer before being sent to the ADC.\n\nThe ADIN2111 has five power supply domains and requires a\nminimum of one supply rail. See the following power supplies:\n\nTWO PORT SWITCH\n\n\u25ba AVDD_H is the analog power supply input for the analog front\n\nend (AFE) circuitry in the ADIN2111.\n\n\u25ba AVDD_L is the analog supply voltage for the internal LDO cir-\n\ncuits. AVDD_L can be connected to the AVDD_H rail in singlesupply mode, or to an alternative lower voltage rail in dual-supply\nmode for lower power consumption.\n\u25ba DVDD1_1P1 and DVDD2_1P1 are the 1.1 V digital core power\nsupply inputs for Port 1 and Port 2 PHYs. DVDD_1P1 and\nDVDD2_1P1 can operate from the internal 1.1 V LDO outputs\navailable on the DLDO1_1P1 and DLDO2_1P1 pins. Alternatively, DVDD1_1P1 and DVDD2_1P1 can be driven from an\nexternal 1.1 V supply for lower power consumption. Note that\nDLDO1_1P1 and DLDO2_1P1 must not be connected together.\n\u25ba VDDIO is the digital power supply input for the ADIN2111 MAC\ninterface, MDIO, and digital inputs/outputs (I/Os). VDDIO can be\nconnected directly to the AVDD_L rail or to an external power\nrail.\nThe System Level Power Management section describes various\napplication circuits that can be used as reference.\nanalog.com\n\nThe ADIN2111 internal two port switch manages the traffic between\nthe SPI host, Port 1 PHY, and Port 2 PHY. The following modes of\noperations are available for the switch:\n\u25ba Store and forward (to or from the SPI host)\n\u25ba Store and forward (port to port)\n\u25ba Cut through (port to port or SPI host to port).\n\nThe port to port traffic is set to cut through by default. To change\nto store and forward operation, reset the port cut through enable bit\n(PORT_CUT_THRU_EN) to 0 in the Configuration Register 2.\nThe switch has a table of 16 MAC addresses that are used determine where to forward frames. A configurable default operation\nexists for frames with unknown destination addresses (DAs).\nThe switch integrates seven FIFOs with a total of 28 kB of buffer to\nsupport the port to port and host to port traffic:\n\u25ba 4 kB host to Port 1 PHY/Port 2 PHY transmit FIFO\n\u25ba 4 kB Port 1 PHY to host high priority receive FIFO\n\u25ba 4 kB Port 1 PHY to host low priority receive FIFO\n\nRev.

Single twisted pair autonegotiation\nis performed using differential Manchester encoding (DME) pages\nexchanged between the local device and its link partner. At a high\nlevel, autonegotiation provides the following functions:\n\n\u25ba 1.0 V p-p and 2.4 V p-p mode (high level)\n\u25ba 1.0 V p-p only mode\n\nThe high level transmit operating mode allows the ADIN2111 to\nsupport both voltage levels. The operating level can then be automatically configured during autonegotiation (if enabled) based\non the link partner capabilities. Note that in high level transmit\noperating mode, AVDD_H must be supplied with 2.4 V or higher for\nthe device to work properly.\n\n\u25ba Transmit\n\u25ba Receive\n\u25ba Half duplex\n\u25ba Arbitration\n\nThe mode of operation is configured through the P1_TX2P4_EN\n(Port 1) and P2_TX2P4_EN (Port 2) hardware configuration pin\nsignals (see the Transmit Amplitude section). The ADIN2111 also\nconfigures the default value for the transmit level register bits used\nfor the autonegotiation process based on the level configured on\nthose two pins (see the Transmit Amplitude Advertisement section).\n\nDuring the autonegotiation process, the local device advertises its\nown capabilities and compares them to those received from the link\npartner. The arbitration mechanism defines the operating modes\nelected so that the transmit amplitude mode and leader/follower\nselection are configured for the linked devices.\n\nThe ADIN2111 is configured in high level transmit operating mode\nby default on Port 1 (respectively Port 2) if the P1_TX2P4_EN\n(respectively P2_TX2P4_EN) pin is left floating (internal pull-down\nresistor).\n\nIf the link is dropped, the autonegotiation process restarts automatically. An autonegotiation restart can also be requested by writing\nto the autonegotiation restart bit (AN_RESTART) in the BASE-T1\nautonegotiation control register (AN_CONTROL) of the respective\nPHY.\n\nLEADER/FOLLOWER CONFIGURATION\nThe 10BASE-T1L standard uses a leader/follower clock scheme.\nThis scheme is commonly used in full duplex transceiver standards\nwith echo cancellation.\nOn a 10BASE-T1L link, one PHY is designated as the leader, and\nthe other PHY as the follower. Autonegotiation is used to determine\nwhich PHY is the leader and which is the follower. Leader and\nfollower assignment does not generally matter.\n\nThe autonegotiation process can take time to complete, depending\non the number of pages exchanged, but is always the fastest way\nto bring up a link. Clause 98 of the IEEE 802.3 standard details the\nsequence timers and DME pages timing related to autonegotiation.\nAutonegotiation is enabled by default for both ports of the\nADIN2111, and it is strongly recommended to always keep it enabled.\nTransmit Amplitude Advertisement\n\nSoftware Configuration\nThe leader and follower configuration bit (CFG_MST, accessible via\nthe MDIO bridge for each PHY) is used to configure the respective\nPHY role. This bit is only used when autonegotiation is disabled.\nOtherwise, this bit is set or reset during the autonegotiation process\n(see the Autonegotiation section).\nTable 9.

This bit is read only and configures Port 1 PHY\n(respectively Port 2 PHY) ability advertisement based on the\nP1_TX2P4_EN (respectively P2_TX2P4_EN) hardware configuration pin signal, as described in the Transmit Amplitude section.

However, it can only request operation at the 2.4\nV p-p transmit level.\nSoftware Configuration\nThe ADIN2111 transmit level on the Port 1 PHY (respectively Port\n2 PHY) can also be configured in software using the following\n10BASE-T1L autonegotiation advertisement bits on the respective\nPHY:\n\u25ba AN_ADV_B10L_TX_LVL_HI_ABL: high level transmit operating\n\nmode ability bit\n\u25ba AN_ADV_B10L_TX_LVL_HI_REQ: high level transmit operating\nmode request register bits\nThe higher transmit level must be enabled on Port 1 (respectively\nPort 2) with the P1_TX2P4_EN (respectively P2_TX2P4_EN) hardware configuration pin signal to configure the two autonegotiation\nadvertisement bits through software. See the Transmit Amplitude\nsection for details.\nIf it is required to only operate the Port 1 PHY (respectively Port 2\nPHY) at the 1.0 V p-p transmit level operation, clear the respective\nAN_ADV_B10L_TX_LVL_HI_ABL bit, so that 2.4 V p-p transmit\nlevel operation is not advertised. In this case, autonegotiation can\nonly resolve to 1.0 V p-p transmit level operation, irrespective of the\nsetting that the remote PHY advertises.\n\nAutonegotiation supports the following features to define the transmit amplitude to use between a local node and its link partner:\n\u25ba Advertise the high voltage transmit ability from the local node\n\u25ba Request to use the high voltage transmit level from the local\n\nnode\n\n\u25ba Read the link partner transmit level ability and transmit level\n\nrequest\n\u25ba Select the autonegotiation and transmit level operating mode\nIf the ADIN2111 PORT1 PHY (respectively Port 2 PHY) is configured in high voltage mode, the autonegotiation process determines\nanalog.com\n\nRev.

See the Leader/Follower Configuration\nsection for more details on the leader/follower configuration.\nForced Leader/Follower Configuration\nAdvertisement\nEach of the ADIN2111 PHYs can be forced to operate as a leader (or follower). Forced configuration must be used with caution\nbecause a configuration fault can occur if the link partner is also set\nin forced mode as a leader (or follower), resulting in autonegotiation\nfailure. The ADIN2111 can be forced to operate as a leader or\nfollower on each PHY using the force leader/follower configuration\nregister bit (AN_ADV_FORCE_MS) in the BASE-T1 autonegotiation\nadvertisement register, Bits[15:0] (AN_ADV_ABILITY_L).\nRead Link Partner Leader/Follower\nConfiguration\nThe link partner advertised leader/follower setting can be read\nusing the following bits on each of the ADIN2111 PHYs:\n\nanalog.com\n\n\u25ba AN_LP_ADV_FORCE_MS: link partner force leader/follower\n\nconfiguration register bit\n\n\u25ba AN_LP_ADV_MST: link partner leader/follower configuration reg-\n\nister bit\n\nThese bits update during the autonegotiation process and are valid\nwhen the autonegotiation complete register bit (AN_COMPLETE) in\nthe BASE-T1 autonegotiation status register is set on the respective\nPHY.\nLeader/Follower Resolution\nThe leader/follower resolution between a local PHY and its remote\nlink partner can be predefined or defined during autonegotiation.\nWhen using autonegotiation, the internal logic determines the roles\nso only one leader is present on the link."

Typical MDI Circuitry with Power Coupling for the ADIN2111\n\nSPI\nThe ADIN2111 can be interfaced to the host controller via the\nfour-pin SPI, allowing frame transfer and control of the internal\nswitch MAC registers and the internal PHYs core management\nregisters via the SPI to MDIO bridge.\nThe interface is compatible with both IEEE Standard 802.3 Clause\n22 and Clause 45 management frame structures (see the Register\nSummary: 10BASE-T1L Single Pair Ethernet PHY Core (ADIN2111)\nsection).\nThe SPI is compatible with the OPEN Alliance SPI protocol and\nsupports a generic SPI mode. The SPI operating mode is set using\nthe SPI_CFG0 and SPI_CFG1 hardware configuration pin signals\n(see the Hardware Configuration Pins section).\nHARDWARE INTERRUPT (INT)\nThe ADIN2111 can generate a hardware interrupt to a host controller using the INT pin. This pin can be configured to trigger interrupts\nfrom the following sources:\n\u25ba PHY 1/PHY 2 status\n\u25ba PHY 1/PHY 2 data ready\n\u25ba PHY 1/PHY 2 system errors\n\u25ba Frame and overflow errors\n\u25ba IEEE 1588 timestamp capture\n\u25ba Reset interrupt\n\nFollowing a hardware interrupt on the INT pin, the interrupt source\ncan be checked using the PHY subsystem interrupt status register\n(PHY_SUBSYS_IRQ_STATUS).\nHardware Reset Interrupt\nEach PHY of the ADIN2111 can also be configured to generate\na hardware interrupt after a hardware reset (RESET pin pulled\nlow) by setting the CRSM_HRD_RST_IRQ_EN bit in the system\ninterrupt mask register (CRSM_IRQ_MASK) of the respective PHY.\nAlthough both PHYs can be used to generate a hardware interrupt,\nit is recommended to use PHY 1 for this purpose.\nFollowing a hardware interrupt received on the SPI host from the\nINT pin, the PHYINT bit (respectively P2_PHYINT bit) on the Status\nRegister 0 (respectively Status Register 1) is also set to 1, notifying\nan interrupt from PHY 1 (respectively PHY 2).\nThe interrupt source can then be checked using the\nCRSM_HRD_RST_IRQ_LH bit in the system interrupt status register (CRSM_IRQ_STATUS) of the respective PHY.\nSoftware Requested Interrupt\nFor system validation with an external host controller, each PHY of\nthe ADIN2111 can be requested to generate a hardware interrupt\non the INT pin using the CRSM_SW_IRQ_REQ bit in the system\ninterrupt mask register (CRSM_IRQ_MASK).\nAlthough both PHYs can be used to generate a hardware interrupt,\nit is recommended to use PHY 1 for this purpose.\n\nSwitch Subsystem Interrupt\n\nFollowing a hardware interrupt received on the SPI host from the\nINT pin, the PHYINT bit (respectively P2_PHYINT bit) in the Status\nRegister 0 (respectively Status Register 1) is also set to 1, notifying\nan interrupt from PHY 1 (respectively PHY 2).\n\nWhen an interrupt occurs, the system can poll the Status Register 0\n(STATUS0) and the Status Register 1 (STATUS1) to determine the\norigin of the interrupt.\n\nThe interrupt source can then be checked using the\nCRSM_SW_IRQ_LH bit in the system interrupt status register\n(CRSM_IRQ_STATUS) of the respective PHY.\n\nThe switch subsystem interrupts can be configured to trigger the\nINT pin using the Interrupt Mask Register 0 (IMASK0) and the mask\nbits for driving the interrupt pin register (IMASK1).\n\nPHY System Error Interrupts\n\n\u25ba Software requested interrupt\n\nPHY Subsystem Interrupts\nThe following conditions can be selected to generate an interrupt on\neach of the ADIN2111 PHYs:\n\u25ba MAC interface frame checker/generator interrupt\n\u25ba MAC interface buffers overflow/underflow interrupt\n\nEach of the ADIN2111 PHYs can also generate system errors\ninterrupts.

B | 21 of 135\n\n\fData Sheet\n\nADIN2111\n\nTHEORY OF OPERATION\nThe ADIN2111 must be hardware reset to recover from a system\nerror interrupt from one of the two PHYs (CRSM_IRQ_STATUS\nreserved bits read as 1 on the respective PHY).\nRESET OPERATIONS\nThe ADIN2111 supports the following chip resets:\n\u25ba Power-on reset\n\u25ba Hardware reset\n\u25ba Software reset\n\u25ba MAC subsystem reset\n\u25ba PHY 1/PHY 2 subsystem reset\n\nAll of these resets put the ADIN2111, including the two PHY cores\nand the internal switch, into a known state.\nPower-On Reset\nThe ADIN2111 includes a power supply monitoring circuit to ensure\nthat the chip has the proper voltage supply before initiating the\npower-up sequence. During power-up, the ADIN2111 is held in\nhardware reset until each of the supplies crosses its minimum rising\nthreshold value and the power is considered good.\nHardware Reset\nA hardware reset is initiated by the power-on reset circuitry or\nby asserting the RESET pin low for a minimum of 10 \u00b5s. The\nADIN2111 includes deglitch circuitry on this pin to reject pulses\nshorter than 1 \u00b5s.\nWhen the RESET pin is deasserted, all the input/output (I/O) pins\nare held in tristate mode, the hardware configuration pins are\nlatched, and the I/O pins are configured to their functional mode.\nWhen all the external and internal supplies are valid and stable, the\ncrystal oscillator circuit is enabled. After the crystal starts up and\nstabilizes, the phase-locked loop (PLL) enables. After a delay of\n90 ms (maximum) from the deassertion of the RESET pin, all the\ninternal clocks are valid, the internal logic releases from reset, and\nall the internal SPI, PHY 1, and PHY 2 registers are accessible from\nthe SPI.\nThe CLK25_REF clock output stays low while the RESET pin is\nasserted low and remains low for another 70 ms (maximum) after\nthe RESET pin deasserts.\nSoftware Reset\nA chip software reset can be initiated by writing 1 to the SWRESET\nfield of the software reset register (RESET). Note that the software\nreset does not reset PORT2 PHY. The PORT2 PHY can be reset\nusing the hardware reset or PHY subsystem reset.\nIf a transmission is taking place when the SPI software reset is\ninitiated, the frame transmission stops abruptly and a runt or a\n\nanalog.com\n\nframe with a bad cyclic redundancy check CRC can be transmitted.\nOnce the chip is reset, the ADIN2111 is ready to bring up links.\nWhen this software reset is initiated, a full initialization of the chip,\nalmost equivalent to a hardware reset, is done. The I/O pins are\nheld in tristate mode, the hardware configuration pins are latched,\nand the I/O pins are configured for their functional mode. The crystal oscillator circuit is enabled, and after the crystal starts up and\nstabilizes, the PLL is enabled. Approximately 10 ms (maximum)\nafter writing the RESET register, the internal logic releases from\nreset and the internal SPI, as well as the two PHY registers, are\naccessible.\nThe system ready bit (CRSM_SYS_RDY) in the system status\nregister (CRSM_STAT) on each PHY indicates that the start-up\nsequence is complete, and the respective PHY is ready for normal\noperation.\nThe CLK25_REF clock output remains low for 25 ms (maximum)\nfollowing a software reset.\nPHY Subsystem Reset\nA PHY subsystem reset is initiated on the ADIN2111 PHY 1\n(respectively PHY 2) by setting the respective PHY subsystem\nreset register bit (CRSM_PHY_SUBSYS_RST) to 1 in the PHY\nsubsystem reset register (CRSM_PHY_SUBSYS_RST). The reset\nis applied for typically 1.2 \u00b5s, and then this bit self clears. All\nof the PHY 1 (respectively PHY 2) digital circuitry is reset, and\nany available active link drops. The PHY 1 (respectively PHY 2)\nsubsystem reset does not alter the values of the management\nregisters, which remain accessible throughout the sequence. The\nsubsystem reset is a short reset and can be used to put the device\ninto a known state while retaining the internal register contents.\nMAC Subsystem Reset\nA MAC only software reset can be initiated by writing the required\npair of keys to the software reset register (SOFT_RST). The reset\nis applied for about 1.2 \u00b5s. The MAC subsystem reset interrupts\nany transmit/receive packet exchange between the MAC and the\ntwo PHYs, but does not drop any existing link or prevent a link from\nbeing established. The MAC subsystem reset does not alter the\nvalues of the PHY registers.\nNote that PHY 1 must be out of software power-down for the MAC\nsubsystem reset to take effect.\nSTATUS LEDS\nThe ADIN2111 provides two configurable LED pins for each port:\nP1_LED_0, P1_LED_1, P2_LED_0, and P2_LED_1 (also noted as\nPx_LED_x).\nThe LED pin signals can be used to connect external LEDs to\nindicate the ADIN2111 link status and transmit or receive activity.\nThe activity assigned to each LED is configurable through the LED\ncontrol register (LED_CNTRL).\nRev. B | 22 of 135\n\n\fData Sheet\n\nADIN2111\n\nTHEORY OF OPERATION\nThe LED pins are suitable for ultra low power LEDs. The maximum\noutput current for each LED pin is 8 mA with a VDDIO = 3.3 V.\nFor higher LED power requirements, use an external transistor, as\ndescribed in the Transistor Controlled LED section.\nThe LED pins can also be connected to a host microcontroller\ngeneral-purpose input/output (GPIO) (configured as a pulse-width\nmodulated input or hardware interrupt). This configuration is useful\nin applications where the user interface must be fully handled by\nan external host controller (for example, an external LED module or\ndisplay).\nIf the LED pins are directly connected to a host controller, place a\nlow value resistance in series between the ADIN2111 LED pins and\nthe host controller to avoid any potential current surge. The resistor\nvalue must be defined based on host controller capabilities and the\nADIN2111 LED pins output current capabilities listed in Table 1.\nLED Pin Multiplexing\nFor the Px_LED_1 pins only (P1_LED_1 and P2_LED_1), an internal multiplexer must be configured to enable the LED signal on the\nrespective pin. Px_LED_1 signals are disabled by default and can\nbe enabled using the DIGIO_LED1_PINMUX bits in the Pin Mux\nConfiguration 1 register (DIGIO_PINMUX) within the respective\nPHY.\nThe Px_LED_0 pins (P1_LED_0 and P2_LED_0) do not need\nmultiplexing.\nLED Polarity\nThe four LED pins can be configured to support various LED circuit\npolarities using the LED polarity register (LED_POLARITY) on the\nrespective PHY. Three polarity modes are available for each LED,\nas follows:\n\u25ba Autosense (default)\n\n\u25ba Active high\n\u25ba Active low\n\nIn autosense mode, the ADIN2111 automatically senses the pin at\npower-up or reset to select the appropriate polarity configuration.\nIn active high mode, the ADIN2111 is configured to drive the LED\nfrom the anode side.\nIn active low mode, the ADIN2111 is configured to drive the LED\nfrom the cathode side.\nExample circuits are described in the LED Circuit Examples section.\nLED Function\nThe LED pins can be configured to display various activities of\nthe ADIN2111 using the LED function feature. The LED function\nis configurable for each LED using the LED0_FUNCTION and\nLED1_FUNCTION bits in the LED control register (LED_CNTRL).\nNote that the 7, 8, 9, and 10 (decimal) bit settings for LED0_FUNCTION and LED1_FUNCTION are not available in LED Mode 2.\nLED Mode\nFor each of the ADIN2111 LED pins, the activity behavior can be\nconfigured using the two LED modes, as follows:\n\u25ba LED Mode 1: blink duty cycle defined using the LED 0 on/off\n\nblink time register (LED0_BLINK_TIME_CNTRL)\n\u25ba LED Mode 2: blink duty cycle automatically defined by the\nADIN2111 based on activity level (%)\nLED Pins Configuration Summary\n\nSee Table 15 for the configuration options of the Px_LED_x pins.\n\nTable 15.

In this mode, all analog and digital\ncircuits are disabled, the clocks are gated off, and all the I/O pins\nare held in tristate mode.\nIn this mode, the ADIN2111 power consumption is equivalent to the\ninternal circuit leakage. The internal registers are not accessible in\nthis mode.\nSoftware Power-Down Mode\nSoftware power-down mode can be used on each PHY to configure\nthe ADIN2111 registers before bringing a link up. In this mode, the\nPHY 1 (respectively PHY 2) analog and digital circuits are in a low\npower state, and the PLL is active and can provide output clocks if\nconfigured to do so. Any signals exposed to the MDI pins, P1_TXP\nand P1_TXN (respectively P2_TXP, P2_TXN), are ignored and any\nactive link on the respective PHY is dropped. The SPI registers are\naccessible, and the device can be configured using software.\nThe PHY 1 (respectively PHY 2) can be configured to automatically enter software power-down mode after power-up, hardware\nreset, or software reset using the P1_SWPD_EN (respectively\nP2_SWPD_EN) hardware configuration pin signal. The ADIN2111\ncan also be instructed to enter software power-down mode by setting the software power-down bit (CRSM_SFT_PD) in the software\npower-down control register (CRSM_SFT_PD_CNTRL) within the\nrespective PHY.\nThe software power-down status bit (CRSM_SFT_PD_RDY) in the\nsystem status register (CRSM_STAT) indicates that the respective\nPHY is in software power-down mode.\nThe ADIN2111 PHY 1 (respectively PHY 2) exits software powerdown mode when the CRSM_SFT_PD bit is cleared within the\nrespective PHY. After exiting software power-down, and if autonegotiation is completed, the PHY 1 (respectively PHY 2) attempts to\nbring a link up.\nNote that it is necessary to bring PHY 1 out of software power-down\nmode to establish a link on PHY 2.\n\nanalog.com\n\nRev.

The ADIN2111 reads the configuration pin level\nimmediately after power-up, hardware reset, or software reset,\nand configures the two PHY settings accordingly. When active,\nthe ADIN2111 immediately attempts to bring up a link on each\nPHY, and the hardware configuration pins can then be used with\ntheir main pin function. These pins can be used in unmanaged or\nmanaged configuration.\nThe unmanaged configuration refers to the ADIN2111 PHY parameters being configured by the hardware configuration pins. This\nmode can be used when the system requires a static configuration\nof the ADIN2111 port settings without the need for software control.\nIn this context, the port to port operation on the ADIN2111 is\nconfigured in cut through.\nThe managed configuration refers to the full control of the\nADIN2111 using software via the SPI. The two PHYs, MAC layer,\nand the store and forward switch can be configured in software.\nThe configuration pins can be connected to the external host or\nhardware configured using pull-up/pull-down resistors. When active,\nthe host controller can override any of the ADIN2111 hardware\nconfigurations set by the hardware pins after power-up, hardware\nreset, or software reset.\nUNMANAGED APPLICATIONS\n\n\u25ba PHY 1 software power-down mode after reset\n\u25ba PHY 2 software power-down mode after reset\n\u25ba PHY 1 transmit amplitude configuration\n\u25ba PHY 2 transmit amplitude configuration\n\u25ba OPEN Alliance or generic SPI\n\u25ba SPI CRC/protection\n\nAll of the hardware configuration pins have internal pull-up or\npull-down resistors, as shown in Table 8.

In that case, the ADIN2111 is configured by default in cut\nthrough mode (port to port forwarding).\n\nLow\n\nSoftware power-down after reset must be disabled on both port\nPHYs for unmanaged applications, or the ADIN2111 associated\nPHY remains in power-down indefinitely, because the device can\nonly exit power-down from register operation using the SPI (see the\nSoftware Power-Down Mode section).\n\n1\n\nA low value series resistor is recommended.\n\n2\n\nAn external pull-down resistor is recommended.\n\nMANAGED APPLICATIONS\nIn managed applications, the ADIN2111 can be configured by a\nhost controller via the SPI. The host controller can dynamically\nconfigure the device as required by the application.\nIn managed applications, the software power-down after reset functionality can be enabled because the host controller brings the\nADIN2111 to active mode using the management interface.\nHARDWARE CONFIGURATION PIN\nFUNCTIONS\nThe following functions are configurable from the ADIN2111 hardware configuration pins:\n\nanalog.com\n\nUnmanaged Configuration\nOptions\n\nSoftware Power-Down After Reset\nThe P1_SWPD_EN (respectively P2_SWPD_EN) hardware configuration pin signal is used to enable or disable the software power-down after reset feature for PHY 1 (respectively PHY 2). The\npower-down bit (CRSM_SFT_PD) in the software power-down control register is set based on the Px_SWPD_EN signal status during\npower-up, hardware reset, or software reset. CRSM_SFT_PD can\nalso be set using the SPI via the MDIO bridge to enable software\npower-down after reset.\nThe P1_SWPD_EN pin has a weak internal pull-down resistor.\nTherefore, by default, the ADIN2111 Port 1 is configured with\nsoftware power-down after reset enabled.\nThe P2_SWPD_EN pin has a weak internal pull-up resistor. Therefore, by default, the ADIN2111 Port 2 is configured with software\npower-down after reset disabled.\nRev. B | 26 of 135\n\n\fData Sheet\n\nADIN2111\n\nHARDWARE CONFIGURATION PINS\nWhen software power-down after reset is enabled on a port, the\nassociated ADIN2111 PHY enters software power-down after power-up, hardware reset, or software reset. Software power-down\nprovides a lower power mode where most of the ADIN2111 internal\nmodules are turned off.\nThe ADIN2111 PHYs can be configured to exit power-down by\nsetting the CRSM_SFT_PD bit to 0 using the SPI via the MDIO\nbridge.\nFollowing a power-up, hardware reset, or software reset, and if\nautonegotiation is enabled and software power-down after reset is\ndisabled, the respective ADIN2111 PHY starts autonegotiation and\ntries to bring up a link.\nTable 18.

The B10L_TX_LVL_HI_ABLE bit\nreports whether the associated PHY is capable of operating in the\n10BASE-T1L high transmit voltage mode, as described in Table 21.\nIf Px_TX2P4_EN is pulled low during power-up, hardware reset, or\nsoftware reset, the 2.4 V p-p transmit operating mode is enabled\nand the value of B10L_TX_LVL_HI_ABLE is set to 1.\nIf Px_TX2P4_EN is pulled high during power-up, hardware reset, or\nsoftware reset, the 2.4 V p-p transmit operating mode is disabled,\nand the value of B10L_TX_LVL_HI_ABLE is set to 0. In that case,\nthe associated register on the respective PHY cannot be changed\nthrough the SPI. That is, 2.4 V p-p operation is not possible on the\nrespective PHY if it has been configured for the 1.0 V p-p level only\nvia the Px_TX2P4_EN pin.\nThe Px_TX2P4_EN pins have a weak internal pull-down resistor.\nTherefore, by default, the ADIN2111 is configured to support both\n1.0 V p-p and 2.4 V p-p voltage levels on Port 1 and Port 2.\nTable 19.

These\nsections cover various configurations, and some may not be relevant to the intended application. Refer to the Theory of Operation\nsection for more detailed explanations.\nUNMANAGED PHY OPERATION\nFor an unmanaged PHY where there is no control of the ADIN2111\nover the management interface, the hardware configuration pins\ndetermine the operating mode for each PHY (see the Hardware\nConfiguration Pins section). In this context, the device is configured\nto run in cut through mode (Port 1 to Port 2 forwarding)\nThe Disable Software Power-Down Mode After Reset section and\nSet Transmit Amplitude Level section describe the steps required to\nbring up a link in unmanaged applications.\nDisable Software Power-Down Mode After\nReset\nSoftware power-down mode after reset can be disabled for PHY 1\nby asserting the P1_SWPD_EN (respectively P2_SWPD_EN) pin\nsignal high during power-up, hardware reset, or software reset, so\nthat PHY 1 does not enter software power-down mode when it exits\nreset.\nSoftware power-down mode after reset is disabled on PHY 2 by\ndefault (due to the internal pull-up resistor).\nSee the Software Power-Down After Reset section for details on\nhow to configure the software power-down after reset function.\nSet Transmit Amplitude Level\nThe P1_TX2P4_EN (respectively P2_TX2P4_EN) pin signal configures the PHY 1 (respectively PHY 2) to advertise the support of\nboth 1.0 V p-p and 2.4 V p-p transmit level operation, or to only\nadvertise support of the 1.0 V p-p transmit level operation.\nBy default, PHY 1 and PHY 2 are configured to support 1.0 V p-p\nand 2.4 V p-p transmit levels (due to the internal pull-down resistor).\nAssert the relevant pin high or low to disable the support for the 2.4\nV p-p transmit level on the relevant port.\nSee the Transmit Amplitude section for details on how to configure\nthe transmit amplitude level.\nMANAGED PHY OPERATION\nIn a managed PHY application, a host controller such as a microcontroller is used to configure the ADIN2111 operation in software\nvia the SPI interface.\nSimilar to the unmanaged PHY operation, the hardware configuration pins can be used to set up the controlled ADIN2111 (see the\nanalog.com\n\nUnmanaged PHY Operation section for details). Alternatively, the\nhardware configuration pins can directly be controlled by the host\n(for example, GPIO) via an external pull-up or pull-down resistor or\nboth.\nIn managed applications, the software power-down after reset can\nbe enabled. The ADIN2111 stays in software power-down mode\nuntil the software has configured the PHY to be active. When\nactive, the PHY can start autonegotiation and try to bring up a link.\nPower-Up and Reset Complete\nA typical way for software to verify that the device has completed\nthe power-up and reset sequence and is available for normal\noperation is to read the management register that has the IEEE organizationally unique identifier (OUI), model, and revision numbers.\nThe value of this register is unique to each PHY vendor and is a\nnonzero value. If the device has not completed the power-up, the\nvalue does not read properly. In legacy BASE-T PHYs, this value\nis at management interface Register Address 0x2 and Register\nAddress 0x3.\nIn the ADIN2111, the OUI, model number, and revision numbers\ncan be read from the PHY identification register (PHYID). If the\nreset value of the register (0x283BCA1) can be read, the device\nexited reset and is ready for configuration. These fields can also\nbe read at Device Address 0x1F Clause 45 only), Register Address\n0x2, and Register Address 0x3 (Clause 22 and Clause 45).\nThe OUI Bits[3:18] are located in the Vendor Specific MMD 1\ndevice identifier high register (MMD1_DEV_ID1).\nThe OUI Bits[19:24] (MMD1_DEV_ID2_OUI), the model number\nBits[6:0] (MMD1_MODEL_NUM), and the revision number Bits[6:0]\n(MMD1_REV_NUM) are located in the Vendor Specific MMD 1\ndevice identifier low register (MMD1_DEV_ID2).\nTable 23.

This bit is also controlled by the P1_SWPD_EN\n\nRev.

Configure the Interrupt Mask\nRegister 0 (IMASK0) register and the mask bits for driving the\ninterrupt pin (IMASK1) register to enable interrupts as required.\nWrite CONFIG0 and CONFIG2 to set up the required functionality\nof the switch. For example, set the OPEN Alliance chunk size or\nenable cut through, if required.\n\nEach PHY of the ADIN2111 can either be configured to advertise\nsupport of both 1.0 V p-p and 2.4 V p-p transmit level operation or\nto advertise support of only 1.0 V p-p transmit level operation. Refer\nto the Transmit Level Mode Advertisement section for more details.\n1.0 V p-p transmit level operation is required for intrinsically safe\noperation.\nEnable High Voltage Transmit Ability\nThe high voltage transmit ability is set on Port 1 (respectively Port\n2) using the P1_TX2P4_EN (respectively P2_TX2P4_EN) hardware\nconfiguration pin signal.

For example, autonegotiation is\nused to ensure that the modes agree between the two devices on\nwhich PHY operates as leader and which as follower. Autonegotiation is also used to match the transmit level between the two PHYs.\nAutonegotiation is enabled by default for the ADIN2111 PHYs,\nand it is strongly recommended to always keep autonegotiation\nenabled. Autonegotiation is defined by the IEEE standard and includes a number of mechanisms to ensure robust linking operation\nbetween PHYs.

The generating and checking functions can be used together or independently.\nIf the ADIN2111 PHY 1 (respectively PHY 2) transmitted frames\nare looped back at the remote end, the frame checker on PHY\n1 (respectively PH Y2) can be used to check the echoed self\ngenerated frames.\nFrame Generator\nWhen the frame generator is enabled, the MAC interface is ignored\nand the frame generator data is used for transmission on the\nMDI pins. To use the frame generator, the diagnostic clock must\nalso be enabled using the CRSM_DIAG_CLK_EN bit in the CRSM\ndiagnostics clock control register (CRSM_DIAG_CLK_CTRL).\nThe frame generator control registers configure the type of frames\nto be sent (for example, random data, all 1s), the frame length, and\nthe number of frames to be generated.\nThe generation of the requested frames starts by enabling the\nframe generator by setting the FG_EN bit in the frame generator\nenable register (FG_EN).\nWhen the generation of the frames completes, the frame generator\ndone bit, FG_DONE, is set in the frame generator done register\n(FG_DONE).\nFrame Checker\nThe frame checker is enabled by setting the frame checker enable\nbit (FC_EN) in the frame checker enable register (FC_EN). The\nanalog.com\n\nframe checker can be configured to check and analyze received\nframes from either the MAC interface or the PHY using the frame\nchecker transmit select bit (FC_TX_SEL) in the frame checker\ntransmit select register (FC_TX_SEL). The frame checker reports\nthe number of frames received, CRC errors, and various frame\nerrors. The frame checker frame counter registers and the frame\nchecker error counter registers count these events.\nError Counters\nThe frame checker counts the number of CRC errors, and\nthese errors are reported in the receive error count register\n(RX_ERR_CNT). To ensure synchronization between the frame\nchecker error counter and frame checker frame counters, all of\nthe counters are latched when the receive error counter register\nis read. Therefore, when using the frame checker, read the receive error counter first, and then read all other frame counters\nand error counters. A latched copy of the receive frame counter\nregister is available in the frame checker count higher register\n(FC_FRM_CNT_H) and the frame checker count low register\n(FC_FRM_CNT_L).\nIn addition to CRC errors, the frame checker counts frame length\nerrors, frame alignment errors, symbol errors, oversized frames\nerrors, and undersized frame errors.\nThe frame checker also counts frames with an odd number of\nnibbles in the frame, and counts packets with an odd number of\nnibbles in the preamble.\nThe frame checker also counts the number of false carrier events,\nwhich is a count of the number of times the bad start of stream\ndelimiter (SSD) state is entered.\nRev.

To help with this, Analog Devices\n10BASE-T1L products provide a TDR engine that enables cable\nfault detection, distance to fault, and cable length estimation.\nThe diagnostics solution is the combination of a highly accurate\non-chip TDR engine and a set of algorithms that run on a host\nmicrocontroller, allowing maximum flexibility for a wide variety of\ncables and more advanced cable diagnostic capabilities.\n\nFigure 15. ADIN2111 TDR Engine\n\nRev. B | 35 of 135\n\n\fData Sheet\n\nADIN2111\n\nON-CHIP DIAGNOSTICS\nFault Detection with the TDR Engine\nThe Analog Devices algorithm has a time resolution of 8.3 ns,\nwhich translates to a length resolution of less than 1 m and a\nmaximum of 1600 m, with an accuracy of 2%.\nThis fault detector algorithm is capable of finding open and short\nfault conditions even when the ADIN2111 is physically connected\nto another PHY through their MDI, which implies that the link\npartner PHY is potentially transmitting DME pages. Traditional TDR\nmethods struggle to find faults if other signal sources or noise is\nalso present in the same link. This is not the case of the Analog\nDevices solution, which makes it suitable for debugging when there\nis no control over the remote end.\nThe fault detector algorithm is provided as a C-code library containing the high-level functions required for diagnostics. These functions have been optimized to not utilize any advanced processing\nso that they can be executed by any low-power microcontroller.\nA single function call is sufficient to execute the fault detector. The\nfunction returns the type of fault and the distance to the fault in\nmeters from the MDI connector.\nThe fault detect TDR library can be requested from the software\nsection in the landing page of the ADIN1100, ADIN1110, and\nADIN2111.\nTDR Offset Calibration\nThe library includes a function to calibrate the offset of the TDR\nmeasurement. This particular function in the library is useful given\nthat different MDI circuits may introduce variable delays in the\nsignal path, which can contribute to the offset of the length measurement. For instance, an isolation transformer on the MDI is highly\nlikely to introduce a signal delay that corresponds to a couple of\nmeters in length.\nThis calibration is not required to run the fault detector, and an\naverage value is provided by default. However, it is recommended\nfor short cables if accuracy is required. If this calibration is required,\nit can be done once in the lab for a specific MDI circuit implementation, and the offset value can then be stored in nonvolatile memory\nfor future use.\n\nTo run this calibration, a cable with a known length must be attached to the MDI port, and its end must be left open or shorted. NVP\nvalues are generally between 0.5 and 0.9 and are a property of\nthe construction of the cable. In general, an average NVP value of\napproximately 0.65 can be assumed. This calibration is not required\nto run the fault detector, unless higher length accuracy is needed\nor if nonstandard cables are utilized. This calibration can be done\nonce in the laboratory for a given cable, and the values can be\nstored in nonvolatile memory.\nRefer to the C-code driver for more information related to the usage\nof these functions.\nLength/Distance to Fault Accuracy\nThe accuracy of the distance to a fault, or length measurements,\nmainly depends on the NVP value, which is determined by the\naccuracy of the cable length used to perform the NVP calibration.\nTable 26 provides results for induced faults and distance-to-fault\nmeasurements for different cables and lengths. In all cases, the algorithm was successful finding the open or short conditions induced\nduring the test. The NVP value for the Profibus PA cable used in\nthis test was roughly estimated, and the same was used for the\nCat5E and Cat6 cables.\nTable 26.

However, given the\nwide variety of cable types, which have different insertion loss,\nreturn loss, and signal delay characteristics, the library includes\na calibration function that optimizes the algorithm to operate with\nany cable, and estimates its nominal velocity of propagation (NVP)\nfor more accurate length estimations. The length accuracy mainly\ndepends on the accuracy of the NVP value.\nanalog.com\n\nRev.

The MSE or SNR can be mapped to a signal quality indicator (SQI) and can be used for assessing the overall 10BASE-T1L\nlink segment/channel quality.\nThe link quality may be affected by the cable length, the cable\nproperties such as insertion and return loss, presence, quality and\nconnection of the cable shield, number and quality of possible\ninterconnections between cable segments, as well as level of noise\nin the environment around the devices and the cable. Therefore,\nthe link quality can provide useful information during a device\ndesign, product testing, as well as at installation in the system, and\nduring the lifetime of the system.\nSIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO AND BIT ERROR\nRATE\nThere is a statistical relation between a communication channel\nSNR and bit error rate (BER). The relation between white noise\nSNR and 10BASE-T1L BER is shown in Figure 16.\n\nfor a given application. However, the link quality and related error\nrate of the physical layer must be kept at a certain level for reliable\nconnection. The acceptable error rate may be different in noncritical\nmonitoring compared to a time critical automation network or safety\napplication.\nMean Squared Error at PHY Slicer\nThe link quality monitoring inside the PHY is implemented as an\nMSE measurement.\nThe 10BASE-T1L Ethernet uses PAM3 modulation\u2014the data sent\nover the cable is coded into symbols of three voltage levels.\nInside the receiver, after analog and digital signal processing, is\na device called a slicer, which makes the decisions whether the\nincoming signal voltage level represents a +1, 0, or \u20131 symbol. An\nideal received and scaled signal is already at these exact levels.\nHowever, the noise coupled to the Ethernet channel from various\nsources affects the real signal.\nThe PHY measures, for each received symbol, an error between\nthe output of the slicer and the received signal already scaled to the\ncorrect amplitude level as shown in Figure 17. The mean square\nvalue of these errors is then calculated and reported in the PHY\nMSE_VAL register.\nThere is a direct relation between the MSE and SNR.\n1\nSNR = MSE\n\n(1)\n\nSNR dB = \u2212 MSE dB\n\n(2)\n\nFigure 16.

For context, the\nBER 10\u22129 means 1 bit error every 100 sec in continuous 10 Mbps\ndata, which translates to approximately an SNR of 20.0 dB on the\n10BASE-T1L PHY as shown in Figure 16.\nWith an SNR of 21.0 dB, the BER must be 10\u221211, which is 1 bit error\nevery 10,000 sec or 2\u00be hour, and with an SNR of 22.0 dB, the BER\nmust be 10\u221214, which is 1 bit error in 115 days. These examples\nillustrate how the SNR relates to the reliability of the 10BASE-T1L\nEthernet.\nThere are always some errors in any data communication channel.\nThe communication protocols, implemented and operating above\nthe Ethernet physical layer, such as TCP/IP in general use cases,\nor the specific protocols for industrial or building automation ensure\ndata integrity by frame repetition or error correction as appropriate\nanalog.com\n\nFigure 17.

Therefore, reading\nand processing the MSE is logical only when the 10BASE-T1L link\nis up.\nThe frequency of reading the MSE_VAL register is not limited,\nand it can be read as often as the management interface allows.\nTherefore, how often MSE_VAL must be read depends on how fast\nthe link quality is expected to be changing and on how often the link\nquality needs to be assessed and reported or recorded in the end\nsystem application.\nAn example of polling the link status and reading the MSE is as\nfollows:\n\nMSE Interpretation\nThe easiest use of the measured MSE is to compare the value read\nfrom the MSE_VAL register directly with the MSE register value\nrange and to interpret the link quality as outlined in Table 27 or\nTable 28.\nAlternatively, the MSE_VAL register value can be interpreted as the\nMSE as follows:\nMSE dB = 10log10 MSEVAL \u00d7 1 . 5523\n18\n\n(3)\n\nSNR dB = \u2212 10 \u00d7 log10 MSEVAL \u00d7 1 . 5523\n18\n\n(4)\n\nAnd the SNR can be calculated as follows:\n\n2\n\nSQI\n\nSNR (dB)\n\nMSE Register Value Range (hex) BER\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n18 to 19\n19 to 20\n20 to 21\n21 to 22\n22 to 23\n23 to 24\n>24\n\n0x084E to 0x0A74\n0x0698 to 0x084E\n0x053D to 0x0698\n0x0429 to 0x053D\n0x034E to 0x0429\n0x02A0 to 0x034E\n<0x02A0\n\n>10\u22127\n10\u22129 to 10\u22127\n10\u221211 to 10\u22129\n10\u221214 to 10\u221211\n<10\u221214\n<10\u221214\n<10\u221214\n\nPHY SLICER SPIKES AND ERRORS\n\n1.

However, given that the MSE is taken as an average value\nover a period, in cases where the interference is a short transient,\nthe value of the MSE may not reflect this. Yet, there may be enough\naffectation on the received symbols to produce packet errors.\nFor this type of transient interference, the ADIN1100, ADIN1110,\nand ADIN2111 include indicators that keep track of the maximum\nslicer input error and the number of error spikes at the input of the\nslicer. These indicators also offer the advantage that can be read\nwhile there is a 10BASE-T1L link and normal data flow. Thus, these\nindicators can be utilized to track the link integrity before a hard\nfault occurs.\nSlicer Maximum Absolute Error\nAs noted in the Mean Squared Error at PHY Slicer section, after the\nreceived analog signal is processed, the slicer makes the decision\nwhether the received signal corresponds to a +1, 0, or \u22121 (PAM3\nsymbol). For instance, a processed received signal may have a\nvalue of 0.8. Thus, the slicer outputs a +1 symbol, given that 0.8 is\ncloser to +1 than to 0 or \u22121. The closer the processed signal is to\nthe ideal symbol, the more reliable the communication is.\nFigure 18 shows the received processed signals at the input of\nthe slicer and the corresponding ideal symbols at the output of\nthe slicer. Notice that the signal marked as 3 has a value of 0.4.\nTherefore, the slicer outputs a 0 symbol and the actual error is 0.4.\nIf the error is greater than 0.5, the received signal is closer to a\n+1 symbol than to its ideal 0 symbol. Thus, the slicer interprets the\nsymbol as a +1, producing a bit error in the received frame.\nThe slicer maximum absolute error must always be less than a\nvalue of 0.5. Values close to 0.5 or greater than 0.5 indicate that the\nreceived signal integrity has been affected.\n\nTable 28.

This\ncounter is called the slicer error spike counter. The slicer error spike\ncounter tracks the number of received symbols with an absolute\nerror above 0.3125 threshold.\nFigure 18 shows four signals at the input of the slicer, with errors\ngreater than the 0.3125 threshold. Thus, the slicer error spike\ncounter reports a count of four.\nNotice that the threshold (0.3125) has been chosen in a way to\nprovide enough headroom for spikes to be detected before they can\nproduce bit errors.\nRelevant Register Information\nTable 29 shows the relevant register information.

This\nmode supports intrinsic safe applications.\n\nMultiple Supplies Configuration\nFigure 20 shows an overview of the proposed power configuration.\nNote that this configuration requires that AVDD_H = 3.3 V even if\nthe link is established in 1.0 V p-p transmit operating mode via SPI\nor autonegotiation.\n\nFor applications where the ADIN2111 PHY 1 (respectively PHY\n2) must operate in 1.0 V p-p transmit operating mode, the\nP1_TX2P4_EN (respectively P2_TX2P4_EN) pin signal must be\ntied high via a 4.7 k\u2126 resistor (see Figure 19 ). This configuration\nforces the ADIN2111 to only operate in 1.0 V p-p transmit operating\nmode and enables the ADIN2111 PHY 1 (respectively PHY 2) to\noperate from a signal supply voltage at a lower voltage rail (for\nexample, 1.8 V), allowing the user to minimize power dissipation in\nthe system.\n\nFigure 20. Supplies and Capacitors for Multiple Supply 2.4 V p-p and 1.0 V\np-p Transmit Mode\n\nSingle-Supply Configuration\n\nFigure 19. Supplies and Capacitors for Forced 1 V p-p Transmit Mode\n\nFor single-supply operation, the same rail can be used to supply\nthe ADIN2111 AVDD_H, AVDD_L, and VDDIO supply rails. The\nDVDDx_1P1 1.1 V rails can be derived internally or alternatively\nprovided by an external 1.1 V rail. This configuration is shown\nin Figure 21. Note that an optional ferrite bead may be used for\nhigh-frequency filtering on the 3.3 V supply.\n\nTransmit Level = 2.4 V p-p\nThe higher transmit operating mode of 2.4 V p-p supports trunk\napplications and requires a higher AVDD_H supply voltage of 3.3\nV. This mode can be used for longer cable lengths in industrial\nEthernet environments with high noise levels.\nFor the ADIN2111 PHY 1 (respectively PHY 2) to be able to operate\nat 2.4 V p-p, the P1_TX2P4_EN (respectively P2_TX2P4_EN) pin\nsignal must be held low (the pin has an internal pull-down resistor).\nThis mode of operation still allows the 1.0 V p-p operating mode to\nbe selected via SPI or autonegotiation.\n\nanalog.com\n\nRev.

The circuit operates using the active high LED mode.\nAn external transistor, such as an N channel metal-oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET), can be used. The transistor\nmust be selected so that the gate input capacitance is not sinking\ncurrent above the maximum rating of the Px_LED_x pin during\nthe actuation. Refer to the transistor technical specifications for\ninformation. If required, the inrush current can be reduced by\nplacing a resistance between the transistor gate and the ADIN2111\npin, and/or adding a parallel capacitor between the GND and the\nPx_LED_x pin. The additional resistor and capacitor values must be\ndefined based on the transistor selection.\nSelect the R0 and R1 resistors to control the LED current (refer to\nthe selected LED and transistor specifications of the manufacturer\nfor information).\nExternal pull-down resistors (RPD0 and RPD1) with a value of 4.7 k\u03a9\nare recommended. In Figure 25, VCC is the power supply used to\nsupply the LEDs.\n\nVarious circuit configurations are proposed in the following sections.\nA common circuit topology can be used across these options with a\nchange to the passive component values.\nNote that during normal operation, a 25 MHz reference clock\ngenerated from the external clock source input (a crystal or 25 MHz\nexternal single-ended clock) is provided on the CLK25_REF output\npin. This pin can be used as a reference clock for other circuits,\nsuch as another 10BASE-T1L device. CLK25_REF is disabled in\nreset mode.\nExternal Crystal Oscillator\nThe typical connection for an external crystal (XTAL) is shown in\nFigure 26.\nTo ensure minimum current consumption and minimize stray capacitance, make connections between the crystal, capacitors, and\nground as close to the ADIN2111 as possible. Consult individual\ncrystal vendors for recommended load information and crystal performance specifications.\nThe crystal load capacitance (CL) is defined by the crystal vendor. CPCB1 and CPCB2 are the parasitic capacitance between the\nXTAL_I/CLK_IN and XTAL_O and the ground plan beneath, respectively. CX1 and CX2 are the two external load capacitors required for\nthe oscillator to operate.\nAssuming the following:\n\u25ba CPCB1 \u2248 CPCB2 \u2248 CPCBx\n\u25ba CX1 \u2248 CX2 \u2248 CXx\n\nFigure 25. Transistor Controlled LED Configuration\n\nAutosense Polarity\nIn autosense mode, the polarity of the LED is automatically detected during power-up, hardware reset, or software reset. LED_0\n(internal pull-up) and LED_1 (internal pull-down) have different\nautosense behaviors due to their internal pull-up and pull-down\nconfigurations. Use one of the configurations described in the\nActive High LED Polarity, Active Low LED Polarity, and Transistor\nControlled LED sections so that the two LEDs can be controlled the\nsame way.\n\nThen, CXx = 2 \u00d7 CL \u2013 CPCBx \u2013 3 pF\nChoose precision capacitors for CXx with low appreciable temperature coefficient to minimize frequency errors.\nTo ensure minimum current consumption and to minimize stray\ncapacitance, make the connections between the crystal, capacitors,\nand ground as close to the ADIN2111 as possible.\n\nCOMPONENT RECOMMENDATIONS\nThe ADIN2111 requires an external 25 MHz clock, which can be\nsourced from an external crystal oscillator or an external singleended clock.\nThe signal voltage on the XTAL_I/CLK_IN pin (VCLK_IN) must be\na sine or filtered square wave signal with a peak-to-peak voltage\nrange from 0.8 V to 2.5 V. For the single-ended clock option, a\nVCLK_IN with a 1.0 V p-p swing is recommended to achieve best\nperformance.\n\nanalog.com\n\nFigure 26. Crystal Oscillator Connection\n\nRev.

Both single and burst access in multiples\nof 32-bit words is supported. The MSB of the data is transmitted\nfirst.\n\nSPI\nOverview\nThe ADIN2111 register interface is via a 4-wire SPI consisting of the\nfollowing pins: SCLK, CS, SDI, and SDO/SPI_CFG0.\n\nThe R/W and TA fields are defined as follows:\n\u25ba R/W: read/write\n\nThe possible access permissions of the registers are as follows:\n\n\u25ba 0: read\n\n\u25ba R/W: read/write\n\n\u25ba 1: write\n\n\u25ba R: read only\n\n\u25ba TA: turn around\n\n\u25ba W: write only\n\nBurst writes and reads must be in multiples of 4 bytes. The last\nword (4 bytes) written can contain between one byte and four\nbytes of valid data. However, TX_FSIZE is still written with the\noriginal frame size + 2 bytes for the frame header (see Figure\n28). For example, to transmit a 65-byte frame that is prepended\nwith a 2-byte header, 67 is written to TX_FSIZE, but 68 bytes are\ntransferred over SDI. The last byte is not used.\n\n\u25ba R/W1C: read/write 1 to clear\n\nThe ADIN2111 also allows access to the PHY registers via an SPI\nto MDIO leader bridge. See the SPI Access to the PHY Registers\nsection.\nThe following registers have additional access permissions:\n\u25ba R LL: read only, latch low\n\nIt is possible to enable a CRC on the SPI protocol via a hardware\nconfiguration pin on power-up. This 8-bit CRC uses the polynomial\nx8 + x2 + x + 1 seeded with 0x0, and provides up to 3-bit error\ndetection. The 8-bit CRC is included for every control and data\ntransaction after the ADDR bits, and then after every 32-bit dataword for every control transaction. There is no 8-bit CRC after each\n32-bit data-word in data transactions because Ethernet frames\ninclude their own 32-bit CRC.\n\n\u25ba R LH: read only, latch high\n\u25ba R/W SC: read/write, self clear\n\nGeneric SPI Protocol\nThe generic SPI protocol is detailed in Table 33 to Table 40.

Therefore, it is not possible\nto write frame data into the MAC_TX register and read from the\nMAC_RX register at the same time. Because of this, the SPI SCLK\nfrequency must be 25 MHz to achieve full duplex transmissions on\nEthernet at 10 Mbps.\n\nThe time stamp counter can be enabled by setting TS_EN\n(TS_CFG register) to 1 and setting FTSE (CONFIG0 register) to\n1.\n\nMAC Frame: Transmit and Receive\n\nThe ADIN2111 supports a TS_TIMER output signal. TS_TIMER can\nbe started at a defined time relative to the nanoseconds counter.\nThe TS_TIMER counter start time register (TS_TIMER_START) is\nused to set the start time. TS_TIMER then toggles based on the\nhigh and low times configured in high period for the TS_TIMER\nregister (TS_TIMER_HI) and low period for the TS_TIMER register\n(TS_TIMER_LO).\n\nThe 2-byte frame header shown in Table 41 is appended to all\ntransmitted and received frames. This frame header always precedes the frame data (see Figure 28).\nTime Stamp Capture\nOn receive, if TIME_STAMP_PRESENT is asserted, an additional\n4-byte or 8-byte time stamp is provided after the 2-byte header in\nTable 41 and before the data frame. This time stamp can then be\nstored or discarded by software when reading the receive FIFO.\nOn transmit, if EGRESS_CAPTURE is set other than 00, the\nADIN2111 captures the time stamp of the transmitted frame into\nthe respective TTSCxH and TTSCxL registers for Port 1, and\nP2_TTSCxH and P2_TTSCxL for Port 2.\nTo enable the time stamp capture signal pin, enable the P1_LED_0\nor TEST_1 pins to be muxed as the time stamp input pin using the\nDIGIO_TSCAPT_PINMUX bits field in the Pin Mux Configuration 1\nregister (DIGIO_PINMUX).\n\nanalog.com\n\nTime Stamp Timer Output\n\nUse the following sequence to enable the TS_TIMER output:\n1. Configure the P1_LED_0 pin to the TS_TIMER function using\nthe LED control register (LED_CNTRL).\n2. To change the default value of the TS_TIMER from 0 to 1,\nwrite 1 to TS_TIMER_DEF in the timer configuration register"

Write a start time to the TS_TIMER_START register. When the\nnanoseconds counter matches this value, TS_TIMER starts to\ntoggle.\n6. To stop TS_TIMER, write 1 to the TS_TIMER_STOP bit in\nTS_CFG. TS_TIMER returns to the default value as set by\nTS_TIMER_DEF bit in TS_CFG. To start the timer again, write\nto the TS_TIMER_START register.\nNote that If P1_LED_0 is used as the TS_TIMER output, the\ndefault value is dependent on the P1_LED_0 polarity set by the\nLED0_POLARITY bit field.\nTransmit Frame over SPI\nThe following sequence must be followed when using the generic\nSPI protocol in store and forward mode (the ADIN2111 operates in\ncut through mode on the SPI by default):\n1. Verify that there is space for the frame by reading the transmit\nFIFO space register. The internal MAC internally appends a\n\n2-byte size field to the frame in the FIFO. Therefore, ensure that\nthere is sufficient space for the Ethernet frame plus the 2-byte\nheader and 2-byte size field.\n2. Write the size of the frame in bytes, including the 2-byte header\nto the MAC transmit frame size register. If the host appended a\nframe check sequence (FCS) to the frame, this is also included\nin the size.\n3. Write the frame data including the 2-byte frame header to the\ntransmit FIFO using the MAC transmit register. The first byte for\ntransmission is written to TXD, Bits[31:24]. The full frame can\nbe written in a single burst or split up into multiple smaller burst\nwrites. The burst write data must always be in multiples of four\nbytes. That is, the last word (four bytes) can contain between\none byte and four bytes of valid data.\n4. When the end of frame (EOF) byte of a frame is read from the\ntransmit FIFO, the bit transmit ready asserts, and an interrupt\ntriggers if the TX_RDY_MASK is set.\n\nFigure 28.

Set the Px_RX_RDY_MASK bit to 0 to enable an interrupt when\na full frame is received.\n2. If the Px_RX_RDY bit is asserted, read the MAC receive frame\nsize register to determine the size of the received frame.\n3. Read the frame via the MAC receive register. It is possible to\nburst read the entire frame or split it up into multiple smaller\nburst reads. The first byte of the received frame is returned\nin Px_RX, Bits[31:24]. The burst read transaction must be a\nmultiple of four bytes. Some of the last four bytes are padded\nwith 0s if the frame is not a multiple of four bytes in size.\n4. Read Px_RX_RDY again. If the value of the bit is 1, another\nframe is available to read. Repeat from Step 3.\n\nanalog.com\n\nBefore transmitting any frames, write 1 to the transmit cut through\nenable bits.\nThe threshold at which the frame transmit starts can be\nmodified via the host transmit start threshold in cut through\nbit (HOST_TX_THRESH) in the transmit threshold register\n(TX_THRESH). This bit a default value of 1. Therefore, by default,\ntransmit starts immediately on writing to the host transmit FIFO.\nTo ensure that the frame transmission does not under run, the host\ntransmit FIFO has to be written at a rate greater than 10 Mbps. If\nthe frame under runs, the host transmit under run error bit asserts.\nGeneric SPI Errors\nGeneric SPI CRC Error\nIf an SPI CRC error occurs on a write to a register, the register is\nnot written.\nIf the write is to the transmit register, the transmit FIFO is missing\ndata and must be cleared by the host. Similarly, a read of the\nreceive register has missing data in the receive frame, and the\nFIFO must be cleared.\nIf the errored transaction was a write to a configuration register, the\nSPI host must issue the write again. If the software does not know\nwhich configuration, reset the MAC by writing the RST_MAC_ONLY\nkeys to the SOFT_RST register.\nGeneric SPI Transmit Protocol Error (TXPE)\nTXPE asserts when the TX_FSIZE register is written, but the MAC\nstill expects further writes to the transmit register related to the\nprevious frame size written to the TX_FSIZE register. This error\ndoes not occur in the normal operation and indicates an issue\nwith the software driver, for example, two consecutive writes to the\nTX_FSIZE register without any writes to the transmit register.\nIn response to the assertion of TXPE, the host must clear the\ntransmit FIFO.\nOPEN Alliance SPI Protocol\nThe OPEN Alliance SPI protocol Version 1.0 can transfer data\nover the SPI using full duplex operation, achieving a 10-Mbps\nbidirectional frame transfer with an SPI clock frequency in the\nregion of 12 MHz to 16 MHz or greater.\n\nRev.

The parity bit is calculated over the receive data\nheader. The method is odd parity.\nOPEN Alliance SPI Cut Through Mode\nIf cut through mode from or to the host is enabled, the method to\ntransfer frames remains the same as when using store and forward\nmode. However, the frame receive starts when sufficient frame data\nto fill a chunk is received, and the frame transmit starts when a\nconfigured transmit threshold is reached. See the transmit threshold\nregister (TX_THRESH) for details.\nThe cut through mode can be enabled via the receive cut through\nenable bits (RXCTE) and transmit cut through enable bits (TXCTE)\nin the Configuration Register 0 (CONFIG0).\nOn receive, the MAC returns data as it becomes available. Unlike\nin store and forward mode, there may be empty chunks (DV = 0)\nbetween a start of frame (SOF) chunk and an EOF chunk.\nIf the host does not read frames fast enough to keep the receive\nFIFO empty, the frames are then buffered in the receive FIFO as if\nit is operating in store and forward mode. When all the frames are\nread, the FIFO returns to operating in cut through mode.\nOn transmit, the host must provide frame data at a rate fast\nenough (>10 Mbps) to ensure that the frame does not under run\non transmit. If the MAC under runs, TXBUE in the Status Register\n0 (STATUS0) asserts and the MAC stops transmitting the frame in\nprogress and appends a bad CRC to the frame.\nCut Through Transmit Latency\nThe time interval between the start of an SPI data transaction with a\ntransmit header SWO of 0 (frame starts immediately in the chunk),\nand the time TX_EN rises on the media independent interface (MII)\nwith an SPI frequency of 16 MHz and TX_THRESH = 1 is 4 \u03bcs. The\nPHY transmit latency is 3.2 \u03bcs. This makes a total transmit latency\nof 7.2 \u03bcs.\nCut Through Receive Latency\nThe receive latency varies based on the chunk size and the SPI\nfrequency.

If a parity error is detected on a transmit\n\nheader and there is a transmit frame in the process of transferring over the SPI, this frame drops. If the switch is operating in\ncut through mode, the frame transmit stops and a bad CRC is\nappended to the frame.\n\nThe ADIN2111 returns a fixed value of 0x4000_0000 in every\nword until CS goes high. The ADIN2111 responds with DV = 1,\nEV = 1, EBO = 0, and FD = 1 in the first data footer following a\nnew assertion of CS.\nIf there is a parity error on a control transaction, the operation\ndoes not complete. Software can determine which transaction\ncaused the error as the ADIN2111 returns a fixed 0x4000_0000\nanalog.com\n\non SDO for the duration of the SPI transaction. Software can\nthen resend the corrupted control transaction after clearing the\nheader error bit.\n\u25ba Transmit protocol error. Occurs when the ADIN2111 detects protocol errors in the transfer of transmit data chunks. These errors\nare usually due to SPI host firmware issues and do not occur in\nnormal operation. The transmit protocol error bit is set when a\ndata header received by the ADIN2111 indicates data valid (DV =\n1) without a prior start of frame indication (SV = 1), in which case\nthe data chunk is ignored. Or, when the ADIN2111 receives two\ndata headers indicating a start of frame (SV = 1) without an end\nof frame (EV = 1), the ADIN2111 drops the frame data from the\nprevious start of frame indicator and begins accepting the frame\ndata from the second start of frame indicator.\n\u25ba Transmit buffer overflow. Occurs when attempting to write transmit frame data to the ADIN2111 when there is no transmit buffer\nRev. B | 53 of 135\n\n\fData Sheet\n\nADIN2111\n\nSWITCH SPI\nspace available as indicated by the transmit credit field (TXC) of\nthe previous data footer. In this condition, the ADIN2111 ignores\nthe transmit data chunk and sets the host transmit FIFO overflow\nbit, and the frame data already in the buffer is dropped.\n\u25ba Transmit buffer under run. This error can only occur in cut\nthrough mode. The SPI host must always send frame data to\nthe ADIN2111 faster than the network to avoid this error. When\nthis error occurs, the host transmit FIFO under run error bit is\nset, and the ADIN2111 terminates the frame being transmitted\nin a way that invalidates the frame. Additionally, the ADIN2111\nignores any additional frame data received from the SPI host\nuntil it receives an end of frame indication (EV = 1).\n\u25ba Loss of framing error. This error occurs when the CS signal\nis deasserted before the expected end of the data chunk or\ncontrol command. When this error occurs, any transmit frame in\nprogress is dropped, and any receive frame in progress of being\nsent to the SPI host is terminated.\n\u25ba Receive buffer overflow. This error occurs when the SPI host\ndoes not read frame data from the ADIN2111 fast enough. This\nerror can occur both in store and forward and cut through modes.\nWhen this error occurs, the ADIN2111 terminates the frame\nbeing received from the internal PHYs. In store and forward\nmode, no portion of the frame is transferred to the SPI host. In\ncut through mode, the ADIN2111 terminates the frame (EV = 1)\nwith frame drop set (FD = 1).\n\u25ba Control data protection error. The control data protection error\n(CDPE) and the loss of frame error (LOFE) bits assert when\nprotection is enabled on the OPEN Alliance SPI and there is an\nerror on write data received from the host. The write does not\ncomplete in this case. If possible, the software executes the write\nagain. If software does not know which configuration register\nwas written, the device may not be configured properly. In this\ncase, reset the ADIN2111 MAC by writing the RST_MAC_ONLY\nkeys to the software reset register.\nSPI Access to the PHY Registers\nThe ADIN2111 provides indirect access to the two PHY management registers via the internal SPI to MDIO bridge. The eight\nMDIOACCn registers in the SPI register map are used to access\nthe PHY management registers. Each MDIOACCn register corresponds to an MDIO transaction.\nThe MDC default speed is 2.5 MHz. Either a 2.5 MHz or 4.166 MHz\nmanagement data clock (MDC) frequency can be selected via the\nMSPEED bits in the CONFIG2 register.\nThe MDIO leader polls the TRDONE bits of the eight MDIOACCn\nregisters in round robin mode. When the MDIO leader detects that\none of the TRDONE fields is 0, the MDIO leader starts an MDIO\ntransaction. When the MDIO transaction completes, the TRDONE\nbits are set to 1, and the leader proceeds to check the TRDONE\nbits of the next MDIOACCn register.\nEach of the two PHYs has a fixed MDIO PHY address, as follows:\nanalog.com\n\n\u25ba PHY 1 MDIO address: 0x1\n\u25ba PHY 2 MDIO address: 0x2\n\nNote that MDIO_DEVAD is always written with the device ID of\nthe register being accessed. MDIO_PRTAD is set to the respective\nPHY MDIO address, and MDIO_ST is written to 0x0 for Clause 45\naccess (this applies to all of the following Clause 45 examples).\nMDIO PHY Address Determination\nThe ADIN2111 allows access to the two PHY registers via an SPI to\nMDIO leader bridge.\nEach of the two PHYs has a fixed MDIO PHY address, as follows:\n\u25ba MDIO PHY Address 1: PHY 1\n\u25ba MDIO PHY Address 2: PHY 2\n\nClause 45 MDIO Operation Examples\nExample write to PHY 1 Register XYZ:\n1.

MDIO_DATA reflects the contents of\nMDIO Register XYZ.\nContents of PHY Registers\nThe PHY registers provide access to control and status information\nin the management registers.\nThe registers of the PHY Clause 45 register map are made up of\nfour device address groupings (see Table 47) based on the MDIO\nmanageable device (MMD). Within each device address space,\nIEEE standard registers are located in register addresses between\n0x0000 and 0x7FFF, and vendor specific registers are located in\nregister addresses from 0x8000 to 0xFFFF.\nTable 47.

In these cases, the reset value in the\nRev. B | 55 of 135\n\n\fData Sheet\n\nADIN2111\n\nSWITCH SPI\nregister table is listed as pin dependent, which allows the default\noperation of the ADIN2111 to be configured without having to write\nto it over the SPI.\n\n\u25ba PCS_SFT_RST\n\nRecommended Register Operation\n\n\u25ba CRSM_SFT_RST\n\nMany of the PHY registers in the ADIN2111 are defined in the IEEE\nStandard 802.3, and the exact behavior of these registers follows\nthe standard. This behavior is not always obvious and is described\nin this section, in addition to the recommended operation and use of\nthe registers.\n\nIn this example, these are the PMA/PMD, PCS, autonegotiation,\nand Vendor Specific MMD 1 device address locations (per Table\n47).\n\nLatch Low Registers\nThe IEEE Standard 802.3-2018 requires certain MDIO accessible registers to exhibit latch low behavior. The idea is to allow\nsoftware that only intermittently reads these registers to detect\nconditions that can be transitory or short lived. For example, the\nAN_LINK_STATUS bit is required to latch low. When the device\nexits from a reset or power-down state, the latching condition is not\nactive and the value of the AN_LINK_STATUS bit reflects the current status of the link. However, if the link comes up and drops, the\nlatching condition is active. In this case, the AN_LINK_STATUS bit\nreads as 0 even if the link has come back up again in the interim.\nThe latching condition is only cleared when the AN_LINK_STATUS\nbit is read, ensuring the software had the opportunity to observe\nthat the link dropped.\nOne implication of this latch low behavior is that, if software wishes\nto determine the current status of the link, it must perform two reads\nof the AN_LINK_STATUS bit back to back. The first read is needed\nto clear any active latching condition.\nAnother implication is that it is important that software take account of the interaction between MDIO accessible bits that share\na register address. For example, the AN_PAGE_RX bits and\nAN_LINK_STATUS bits reside at the same register address. As\na result, reading the AN_PAGE_RX bits clears any active latching\ncondition associated with the AN_LINK_STATUS bits.\nIEEE Duplicated Registers\nThe IEEE Standard 802.3-2018 covers a very wide range of standards and speeds, from 10 Mbps to 40 Gbps and higher, and\nincludes a large number of clauses. There are registers associated\nwith many clauses, and different PHYs can include different clauses\nand combinations of clauses. Therefore, registers for common\nfunctions like software reset, software power-down, loopback, and\nso on, tend to be implemented in multiple clauses.\nIn the ADIN2111, the physical implementation of these registers is\nin a single location, but they can be accessed at multiple addresses. For example, the software reset bit, can be read or written in\nall the following IEEE MMD locations and vendor specific register\nlocations:\n\n\u25ba B10L_PMA_SFT_RST\n\u25ba B10L_PCS_SFT_RST\n\nHaving multiple address locations for the same register makes\nthe use of the device more complex than necessary, particularly\nin relation to registers that have latch low or self clear access\npermissions. This is an unavoidable consequence of the IEEE\nstandard.\nThe ADIN2111 data sheet only calls out a single recommended\naddress location for each of these IEEE registers to simplify the\noperation and use of the device. In general, the registers introduced in the 802.3cg (10BASE-T1L) section of the standard are\nrecommended over older (equivalent) registers. Often, registers in\na vendor specific address are recommended, particularly where a\nregister brings a number of useful IEEE register bits into a single\nregister address. The ADIN2111 responds to register accesses to\nall the IEEE register address locations covered by the 10BASE-T1L\nstandard when the start up completes after a power-on reset,\nhardware reset, or software reset.\nPHY Subsystem Registers Read Modify Write\nOperation\nAll PHY subsystems register write operations must be performed\nas read modify write operations. If this process is not followed, the\nvalue of the register bits can inadvertently change.\nSWITCH\nFrame Forwarding on Receive\nBy default, the device drops all frames received. To receive frames,\nset up the address filtering table, or change the default operation for\nall receive frames.\nNote that frames can be forwarded from one port to two destinations: the other port and the host SPI port.\nThe device can be configured to forward up to 16 different MAC\naddresses based on the MAC destination address (DA).\nTo receive frames with a particular DA, that DA has to be programmed to one of the 16 ADDR_FILT_x registers. Each register\nis 32 bits wide. Therefore, for example, to program a DA of\n08:00:00:5A:64:68 to ADDR_FILT_x0, write:\n\u25ba 0x0800 to ADDR_FILT_UPR0\n\u25ba 0x005A6468 to ADDR_FILT_LWR0\n\n\u25ba PMA_SFT_RST\n\nanalog.com\n\nRev. B | 56 of 135\n\n\fData Sheet\n\nADIN2111\n\nSWITCH SPI\nto ensure that the counters do not roll over the last value read by\nthe host.\n\nTo forward frames with this DA to the host, set the TO_HOST bit\nfield within the ADDR_FILT_UPRn register to 1. To apply this rule,\nset APPLY2PORT1 or APPLY2PORT2 to 1, accordingly.\n\nTable 48. Port 1 and Port 2 Statistics Counters\n\nMAC addresses can be masked using the ADDR_MSK_x registers.\nFor example, to receive all the MAC addresses in the range\n0x8000005A64xx, write:\n\u25ba 0xFFFF to ADDR_MSK_UPR0\n\u25ba 0XFFFFFF00 to ADDR_MSK_LWR0\n\nFrames that do not match any of the 16 ADDR_FILT_x registers are dropped by default.

Frame Forwarding Algorithm\n\nReceive Priority Queues\nEach of the ADIN2111 PHYs has two different FIFOs on receive: a\nhigh priority FIFO and a low priority FIFO.\nBy default, the low priority FIFO is configured to 12 kB, and\nthe high priority FIFO is configured to 8 kB. The sizes of these\nFIFOs can be changed before receiving or transmitting any\nframes via the P1_RX_LO_SIZE and P1_RX_HI_SIZE (Port 1)\nand P2_RX_LO_SIZE and P2_RX_HI_SIZE (Port 2) fields in the\nFIFO_SIZE register.\nStatistics Counters\nThe ADIN2111 has fifteen 16-bit counters on each port that increment on frame transmit and receive. They roll over to 0 when the\nmaximum value of 65535 is reached and they are not cleared on\nreading. Therefore, the counters must be read every four seconds\nanalog.com\n\nReceive Drop FIFO Full Counter\n\nTO HOST?\nNO\n\nNO"

If there is no space for at least 256\nbytes, the frame is dropped and the P1_RX_DROP_FULL_CNT\n(respectively P2_RX_DROP_FULL_CNT) counter increments. If\nthere is space for at least 256 bytes in the FIFO, the logic\nwrites the frame to the receive FIFO. If the received frame\nexceeds 256 bytes and the receive FIFO fills, the frame\nis dropped and the P1_RX_DROP_FULL_CNT (respectively\nP2_RX_DROP_FULL_CNT) counter increments.\nNote that if a frame is destined for both the host and the other\nport, and the frame is not forwarded in one of the destination FIFOs\nbecause it is full, the frame is not counted as a dropped frame.\nFrame Receive and Transmit Errors\nBy default, received errored frames do not generate interrupts.\nThese frames are dropped and counted, and the software must\nmonitor the statistics counters. The static random-access memory\n(SRAM) error correction code (ECC) error and transmit overflow\nerror are reported in the error status register (ERR_STATUS).\nThese errors result in the INT pin asserting an interrupt, unless\nan error is masked using the error status mask register (ERR_STATUS_MASK). See the SRAM ECC Error section and Transmit\nOverflow Error section.\n\nRev. B | 57 of 135\n\n\fData Sheet\n\nADIN2111\n\nSWITCH SPI\nSRAM ECC Error\nWhen writing a frame to one of the ADIN2111 PHY FIFOs, the size\nof the frame is inserted in a 16-bit word at the front of the frame and\nwritten to the FIFO. A 5-bit ECC is placed alongside the size field.\nWhen this location is read from the SRAM, the ECC is checked. If\na double bit error is detected, the RX_ECC_ERR or TX_ECC_ERR\nbits of the STATUS1 register are set to 1. If a double bit error is\ndetected on reading a frame header from the receive FIFO, the\nframe is not transmitted.\nIn response to an ECC error, a FIFO automatically clears. All\nframes in the FIFO are lost, transmission stops, and a bad CRC is\nappended to the frame that transmitted. The next frame received is\nwritten to a FIFO.\nTransmit Overflow Error\nIf the host attempts to write to the transmission FIFO but there is\nnot enough space, the host transmission FIFO overflow bit field\nasserts (TXBOE). The software checks the space available in the\ntransmission FIFO by reading the transmission FIFO space register\n(TX_SPACE) before attempting to write to it.\nIf this error occurs, the frame is automatically dumped, and the\nsoftware has no other requirement than to clear the TXBOE status\nbit. Note that frames dropped because of a transmission FIFO\noverflow are not counted in the statistics counters.\n\nanalog.com\n\nRev.

Via tenting is also\nrecommended.\nCOMPONENT PLACEMENT AND ROUTING\n\n\u25ba Use a PCB stack with a minimum of four layers. Consider six\n\nlayers or more with external layers used as ground planes to\nimprove EMI issues (optional).\n\u25ba Define copper layer thickness based on the application and\npower requirements.\n\u25ba Use internal layers for the power and ground planes.\n\u25ba Use external layers for the signal traces.\n\u25ba Use via stitching to improve ground and reduce EMI. The\nstitching pattern and via to via gaps are defined based on the\napplication.\n\nPrioritization of the critical traces and components helps simplify\nthe routing exercise. Place and orient the critical traces and components first to ensure an effective layout. The critical components are\nthe crystal and load capacitors, the CEXT_2, CEXT_3, CEXT_6,\nand CEXT_7 capacitors, and all bypass capacitors local to the\nADIN2111 device. Prioritize these components for placement and\nrouting, as follows:\n\u25ba Place the decoupling capacitor as close as possible to their input\n\npins.\n\u25ba Minimize traces turns, and use a 45\u00b0 corner.\n\u25ba Avoid traces crossing power planes on adjacent layers.\n\u25ba Avoid stubs.\n\u25ba Keep the MDI traces (P1_TXP, P1_TXN, P2_TXP, and P2_TXN)\nas short as possible.\n\u25ba Use matched length differential lines for each port with a differential impedance of 100 \u03a9.\n\u25ba Avoid vias on a high speed signal. Place ground vias next to the\nsignal vias to improve the return current path.\nCRYSTAL PLACEMENT AND ROUTING\nParticular attention is required on the crystal placement and routing\nto ensure minimum current consumption, reduce stray capacitance,\nand improve noise immunity.\nFollow these recommendations:\n\u25ba Place the crystal, capacitors as close as possible to the\n\nADIN2111 XTAL_I/CLK_IN and XTAL_O pins.\n\n\u25ba Place the load capacitors close to each other.\n\u25ba Use a local GND plane (copper island) for the crystal and load\n\ncapacitors with a single point connection to the main GND.\n\n\u25ba Reduce parasitic capacitance by keeping the XTAL_I and\n\nXTAL_O traces away from each other.\n\n\u25ba Adding a copper keepout on the layer beneath the crystal can\n\nalso reduce the parasitic capacitance.\n\nPCB STACK\nFollow these recommendations for the PCB stack:\n\nanalog.com\n\nRev.
