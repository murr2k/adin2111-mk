# ADIN2111-MK Single Interface Ethernet Driver

**Author:** Murray Kopit <murr2k@gmail.com>

A simplified Linux kernel driver for the Analog Devices ADIN2111 2-Port Ethernet Switch, configured to operate as a single Ethernet interface (eth0) without switching capabilities.

## Overview

This driver is derived from the original ADIN2111 dual-port switch driver but has been extensively modified to:

- **Remove switching/bridge functionality**: Eliminates all switchdev and bridge-related code
- **Single interface operation**: Registers only one network interface (eth0)
- **Simplified configuration**: Direct ethernet operations without dual-port complexity
- **Maintain hardware compatibility**: Preserves all SPI communication and PHY management
- **Standard networking**: Full compatibility with ifconfig, ip, and standard Linux networking tools

## Quick Start

```bash
# Simple configuration (goal of this driver)
ifconfig eth0 172.16.1.100 up

# Alternative with ip command
ip addr add 172.16.1.100/24 dev eth0
ip link set eth0 up
```

## Files

### Source Code (`src/`)
- `adin2111-mk.c` - Main driver implementation
- `Kconfig` - Kernel configuration
- `Makefile` - Build system
- `adin2111-mk-overlay.dts` - Device tree overlay
- `test-adin2111-mk.sh` - Basic test script

### Tests (`tests/`)
- Comprehensive test suite for validation
- Unit tests, integration tests, and performance benchmarks
- Automated test runner and reporting

## Building

```bash
# Configure kernel
make menuconfig
# Enable: Device Drivers → Network device support → ADIN2111-MK

# Build driver
cd src/
make

# Install module
sudo make modules_install
sudo depmod -a
```

## Loading

```bash
# Load driver
sudo modprobe adin2111-mk

# Verify interface
ip link show eth0
```

## Testing

```bash
# Run basic tests
cd tests/
sudo ./test_runner.py

# Or run integration tests directly
sudo ./integration_tests.sh
```
